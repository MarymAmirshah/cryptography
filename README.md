Welcome to the **cryptography** repository!

This project implements **Shamir's Secret Sharing Scheme** in pure Python. Shamir's Secret Sharing is a cryptographic algorithm that allows a secret to be securely split into parts, giving each participant its own unique part. To reconstruct the original secret, a minimum number of parts (threshold) is required.

## Features

- Easy-to-understand implementation of Shamir's Secret Sharing
- Split a secret into multiple shares
- Reconstruct the secret from a subset of shares

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MarymAmirshah/cryptography.git
   cd cryptography
   ```
2. **Run the code using Python**  
   Explore the scripts and adapt them to your needs.
